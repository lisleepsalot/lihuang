In the beginning of the twentieth century to the 1930s, the Russian art world underwent a series of changes in response to the greater social and political upheavals including the revolution and the civil war. Several avant-garde movements and art styles were created during the period, and socialist realism, the well-known official art language of the Soviet Union, ultimately rose as the art doctrine for the Stalin era and seemingly closes the discussion of the legitimate art for the new society. This very process can be roughly divided into three phases: the pre-revolutionary period from 1902 to 1917 as the first phase; artists absorbed the inspirations from western Europe and subsequently adapted them to diverse, original art styles, including the isms we are familiar in modern art history textbooks: neoprimitivism, suprematism, futurism, and constructivism. The second phase is the period between 1917 (the revolution) to 1932. The end of the civil war and the re-opening of the private art market by NEP fostered an ephemeral post-revolution artistic prosperity, and different artists actively explored the new art and sought to represent the revolution. Or the other way to see it was the artist of the time attempted to redefine the perplexed definition of art and the role of the artists after the chaos (Andrews, 12). Either way, the final phase features the party interventions in art production in the late 1920s and early 1930s, which crowned socialist realism as the doctrine of art for the later twenty years. The most important milestone was the formal proclamation of socialist realism in 1934 at the First All-Union Writer’s conference. <br>


This graph focuses on the period from 1917 to 1932 when a relatively free creative environment (of the early 1920s) juxtaposes with a shared commitment by the leftist artist groups to create new forms of art for post-revolution Russia. More importantly, the revolution has given the artist the impetus to ambitiously envision art as “the herald and the mirror of the social metamorphosis (Bowlt, xxxiii),” and artists had the opportunity to elevate art as an active tool to shape the values of society. Therefore, the conflict in art styles represents the conflict between different utopian aspirations. The two dominant art groups with their adherents who actively wrote and practiced their theories were the constructivist artists and realist artists (who established the framework of socialist realism). Although it is erroneous to oversimplify the exploration of revolutionary art into the confrontation of constructivism and socialist realism, or the predecessor realism, the fundamental conflicts represented by the two schools were the heart of the problem. The industrial, mechanic urbanist art, or the conventional “pure art” with human touches? The abstracted art or representational art? The prospective avant-garde, or the art for the mass that the public could comprehend? Both schools have spaces for justifications. The functional, collective, and industrial core of constructivism does represent the very values Bolsheviks sought to accomplish in the new society, while socialist realism, as the conventional visual language, effectively brought meanings to the public and characterized itself as authentic mass art, and just like how Bowlt put it, It is erroneous to discredit socialist realism as revolutionary by its affinity with Stalin rule: “However autocratic and severe Stalin’s measures in the early 1930s and however uniform their results, they did provide a sense of direction and a definite artistic style to artists perplexed by the many conflicting ideas of the preceding thirty years and conscious of an aesthetic impasse (Bowlt, xl).” Socialist realism does somewhat conclude the intricated discussion of art with the help of forceful interventions, though it is still debatable if it is the right conclusion or if a conclusion was needed at all. Nevertheless, the two competing schools are, if not general summaries, emotional miniatures of the conflicting values in the post-revolution Russian art world. <br>


This graph aims to provide a more omniscient perspective of the Russian art timeline without isolating individual art styles, and hopefully, it opens insights into the discussion of what art truly represents the revolution and the legitimacy of socialist realism as the ultimate revolutionary representation. The graph visually presents the linear development of the different art styles and their interactions (comments, critiques, statements) under the same timeline. Most of the writings that attempt to make sense of the Russian art of the time somewhat failed to demonstrate the evolution of art styles and the external influences and interactions. The most common forms focus on a specific art style like Russian Constructivism by Christiana Lodder, who chronologically establishes a factual framework for constructivism from primary sources. However, Lodder focused more on the factual events of individual artists and the formal qualities of their works, which somewhat neglected the utopian ambitions behind them and the conflicts with other art schools. Similarly, Art into life: Russian Constructivism 1914-1932 dived deeply into the specific art style yet limits the discussion with other art schools solely to their influences on constructivism. Russian Art of the Avant-Garde: Theory and Criticism 1902-1934 edited by John. E. Bowlt offered the most comprehensive accounts for the dialogues between art styles from an omniscient standpoint, but the medium of text still limits the presentation in a chronological, linear narrative. Writings about futurism, for example, are divided into different chapters because the book prioritizes chronological order. Thus, one would have to jump between chapters to link the writings of the same school. Additionally, this chronological narrative to a great extent characterizes socialist realism as the destined result of the discussion. In this case, an infographic has its advantage in demonstrating the intricate influences between art styles while preserving the continuity of the narrative. It allows the reader to identify how linear art movements situate themselves in the bigger framework.<br>


<div class="timeline-title">Footnotes:</div>

<div class="timeline-number">1</div>The isolation of the Russian art world from Europe contributed to the distinct Russian art schools, and the avant-garde arts all took Western Europe inspirations to different extents, thus a timeline of it is required to draw connections. The timeline is simplified for layout reasons, please reference the footnotes for elaborations.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">2</div>The writing of Chernyshevsky has a profound impact on the foundation of Russian realism; it advocated art to duplicate things in art that  “is of interest to man”, to focus on reality, and to attribute a moral and social responsibility.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">3</div>The Wanderers was an ambitious, rebellious art group who practiced the writings of Chernyshevsky by focusing on the contemporary life of the people in the 1870s.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">4</div>The neo primitivist movement was the hybridity between Western avant-garde-styles of Cézanne, Gauguin, Mattise-and Russian traditional indigenous art. This combination foreshadows the later discords within the art group. See 7.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">5</div>Russian Futurism was directly influenced by the Manifesto of Futurism by Filippo Marinetti, the official proclamation of futurism in Western Europe. However, it was interpreted freely by Russian artists.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">6</div>The Ego Futurism represented by A Slap in the Face of Public Taste was more exclusively on literature instead of art in general (Freeman, 65). <br>

<div class="timeline-number">7</div>After the Knave of Diamond Exhibition, the neoprimitivism group was divided into the “Russian” faction-who sought their creativity in indigenous traditions -and the “French”factions-who took Westerns masters as major inspirations.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">8</div>Larionov actively embraces the futurist ideal and claims to form allegiance to Russian traditional arts.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">9</div>Suprematism and neoprimitivism share the core of reducing visual presentations, and one can also see the dynamic composition of Malevich also relate to the tactics of lubok.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">10</div>Tatlin stated that Picasso was one of the three painters who had influenced him most (Lodder, 8). <br>

<div class="timeline-number">11</div>In the writing about the very first constructivist piece, Tatlin stresses the “utilitarian intention of art and its potential to “control over the forms encountered in our new everyday life.”<br>

<div class="timeline-number">12</div>Lissitzky built on and expanded on the idea of Malevich’s Suprematism and mentions the reconstruction of painting, which overlaps with the basic ideas of constructivism.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">13</div>Bogdanov characterized art as a weapon to organize a collective force to shape society and asserted that old art is valuable with proletarian criticisms.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">14</div>Altman in his writing blatantly accuses easel painting of its lack of collective basis and inability to represent the proletariats and advocate futurist art. It is one of the early polemical voices from art groups.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">15</div>Punin emphasizes the logic and factors of science in art making. Art criticism must be “scientific criticism (Punin, 54).”<br>

<div class="timeline-number">16</div>Rodchenko was among the many who had given up on easel paintings. One major incentive to become a constructivist artist was the loss of faith in easel painting.  <br>

<div class="timeline-number">17</div>Lunacharsky, as the head of Narkompros emphasized proletarian art as the central direction while not specifying what is truly proletariat: “art is divided up..in directions. The proletariat is only just working out its own artistic criteria, and no state authority should regard any of them as belonging to the state (Lunacharsky, 9).” This open position enabled diverse interpretations of proletariat art.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">18</div>Lunacharsky reiterates the need to leave spaces during the first years of the revolution to “create for itself a sufficiently expressive and artistic form.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">19</div>Pertsov sensed the flaws of equating art with production  on a practical basis and called for finding the balance between the two instead.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">20</div>Avatov, as a member of Inkhuk, took a semi-critical standpoint on the leftist artist. acknowledging the rationale of using abstracted art to distinguish proletariat art from bourgeois art forms, he questions nonobjective art as a comprehensible form and stresses the importance of “purposefulness” in industrial art.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">21</div>The writing of Gan is considered the first attempt to formulate the long-existing constructivism ideology and equate them with communism. Different from the advocation of futurism that rejects the past, Gan took a more radical standpoint to refute art and fully embraces the industrial route where machines replace humans in art making. “Death to Art! (Gan, 48).” In chapter 3, Gan characterizes realistic art as reactionary. <br>

<div class="timeline-number">22</div>Although the French faction of Knave of Diamond was not active in the discussion of the new art, when the AKhRR was established, they were among the first group that accepted the theories of AkhRR.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">23</div>The declaration emphasizes proletariat art as mass art that is comprehensible to the public and educates the public. It indicated “heroic realism” as the ideal art style.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">24</div>Another alternative to constructivism suggested in Russian Constructivism, is organic constructivism represented by the practices of Mikhail Matyushin. Lodder argues that the early constructivist practices by Tatlin and Miturich referenced not only machinery forms but also natural forms, and this nature-inspired constructivism managed to survive as a constructivist alternative (Lodder, 205).<br>

<div class="timeline-number">25</div>The medium of photomontage existed before the official proclamation of constructivism, but it rose to prominence among constructivists in response to creating agitational poster art. Lodder argues that the flourishing of photomontage facilitated the decline of constructivism because it brought the art movement back to the traditional, nonrepresentational narrative and limited further explorations. Nevertheless, photomontage as a utilitarian skill to create posters greatly outlived constructivism itself.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">26</div>Style and Epoch envisions the ideals of a Constructivist architecture and the ways to obtain the goals. It shared the constructivist core of systematic making and championed machines and technology. The book started the constructivist movement in Russian architecture.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">27</div>LEF was a publication associated closely with formalism and constructivism and endorses leftist art as the future of art.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">28</div>The statement was from the exhibition in VKHUTEMAS that intended to evoke discussion on easel art and industrial art. The statement claims to admit artistic labor, which was rejected in earlier ideals like Gan; it claimed to rationalize artistic labor and not sentimentalize objects, and it limited the practice of constructivism in specific aspects. <br>

<div class="timeline-number">29</div>The writing of AKhRR accuses leftist art of transferring Western art to soil aliens economically and psychologically. and claims the collapse of left tendencies of art. It, again, champions “heroic realism” as the only genuine new art for the future.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">30</div>Organized by VKHUTEMAS students, the Society of Easel Painters was against the production of art and stated “only art of high quality” can affect the reconstruction of a new way of life and create a new culture.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">31</div>The decree centralized poster production under IZOGIZ, the State publishing house of fine art, and called for more control of artistic production.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">32</div>The decree of 1932 disbanded the small art organizations and paved the road for the official proclamation of social realism. The disbandment of minor art groups uprooted the basic units of artistic creativity, the communities that cultivated art movements like neoprimitivism.<br>

<div class="timeline-number">33</div>The First All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers intended to show cultural unity among the U.S.S.R. The congress officially championed heroic realism and proclaimed it as socialist realism.<br>
